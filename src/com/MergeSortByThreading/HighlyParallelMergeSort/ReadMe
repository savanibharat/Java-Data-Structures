This program uses much more memory then you can think of.

Look at the snapshot that I have provided in this package "ThreadingtaskUsage.png".

If your heap size is less you will get this error java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

You can change heap size from Run Configurations (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9816214/about-out-of-memory-exception)
			
			normally its java -Xms5m -Xmx15m MyApp -Xms set initial Java heap size -Xmx set maximum Java heap size

			and in eclipse under java run configuration as VM argument -Xms128m

			-Xmx512m
		
			-XX:permSize=128M

			-XX:MaxPermSize=384M
			
A word of advice

	Whenever you are using too much memory you must know what your are using and what you are dealing with.
