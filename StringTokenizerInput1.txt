In this paper we introduce a unique definition of data integrity protection We propose an
arrangement using double exclusive or (XOR) encryption and providing this new concept of
data integrity protection Two applications of our arrangement are shown an impractical one
conforming to our data integrity definition and the Frogbit heuristic that we propose as our main
contribution
A stream cipher operates on cleartext messages serially applying XOR encryption to each
message bit It uses a pseudo-random bit generator (PR generator) for which the seed is derived
from the cipher secret key Our definition of data integrity protection uses the bit-serial
characteristic of a stream cipher Let us assume that a bit-serial cleartext message is encrypted
into ciphertext by a sender and that a session key is established for this purpose The legitimate
receiver decrypts the ciphertext and gets the recovered cleartext An adversary is given the
opportunity to modify the ciphertext bits in transit from the sender to the receiver
Definition We define a cipher that offers data integrity protection as one where the modification
of a single bit in the ciphertext by the adversary forces the randomization of the
remaining portion of the recovered cleartext
